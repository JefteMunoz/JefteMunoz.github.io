This website will make a forecast for the following cities: Franklin, Springfield, and Greenville. The website will provide information such as temperature in both Farenheit and Celsius, altitude, wind, and etc. </p>
        <h2> Audience </h2>
        <p> My target is people of any age, any type of income or education level, un-employed or employed.

This website will provide the audience with the information they are searching. </p>
