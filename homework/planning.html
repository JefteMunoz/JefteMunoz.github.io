        <h1> Project Proposal </h1>
            <div class="proposal">
                <h2> Project Purpose </h2>
                <p> This project is intended to be a website for basketball fans, specifically for fans of the San Antonio Spurs.  It is intended that the content will show the team’s schedule, roster, results, and if possible highlights of each game. If it is possible the website will help users find tickets for the games. </p>
                <h2> The Audience</h2>
                <p> The users that I plan for are of any age and gender, and their income can be of any level. They should preferably be fans of the San Antonio Spurs and will be searching for their games’ time and date, scores and if they wish buy tickets to watch them play. This website will provide them with what they’re searching for. </p>
                <h2> Persona </h2>
                <img src="../project/images/kawhi_home_small.jpg" alt="Kawhi James-Irving" title="Kawhi James-Irving">
                <p> Kawhi James-Irving is 24 years old; he was born in France, but has lived most of his life in the United States, he is single and is a college student at BYU-Idaho majoring in Accounting. Kawhi currently lives in San Antonio, Texas, as he does his internship. He is a big basketball fan and a Spurs fan. He wants to watch as many live games as possible before he returns to Rexburg. He uses his laptop to navigate, more than his other devices, and search for the San Antonio Spurs results on a weekly basis. Kawhi spends most of his free time playing basketball and wearing his Spurs jersey. </p>
