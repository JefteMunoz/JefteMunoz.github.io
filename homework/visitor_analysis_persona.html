                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p> Envision's audience is people over their 20's, people who are seeking healthcare, on a average income and even people who are searching to invest. A visitor may meet their expectations easily by searching what they need to find in their menu. Their navigational components were together in the top of the website next to the company's logo which made it very easy to find and navigate. Envision has done a very good job in making a visit to their website in a mobile device enjoyable. Did it facilitate my navigation? Yes. The reason is simple. They followed the design principles in creating the website. </p>

                <p> The perfect persona for this website would be a 30 year old person, man or woman, with an average income who is searching for health care or somewhere to invest, or even searching to be charitable and donate, even searching for a company to do an intership and wants to know more about them. </p>
